    <summary>How to create a virtual host in Apache.</summary>
    <cheat title="Virtual hosts" id="vhosts">
        <p>
            Using virtual hosts (vhosts) in Apache you can map specified directory to the domain name.
            It is not only needed when you want to serve more than one domain on the server, but could
            be also useful during local development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to define new virtual host, add following code to your Apache config. This is the
            simplest form, there are more directives you can use, but below one will work.
        </p>
        <snippet language="none">
<![CDATA[<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot [path to the site]
    ServerName domain.tld # replace it by your own value
</VirtualHost>]]>
        </snippet>
        <p>
            When doing local development, you need to map specified domain name to respective IP address,
            usually <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Theoretically you can set up your own DNS server, but it's
            unneeded complication, unless you don't use advanced features, such as domain wildcards etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open the file <code>/etc/hots</code> (or <code>X:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</code> on
            Windows) and add a following entry to it:
        </p>
        <snippet language="none">
            <![CDATA[127.0.0.1 domain.tld]]>
        </snippet>
        <p>
            Restart Apache process if it was running and you should be able to open <code>domain.tld</code>
            in your browser.
        </p>
        <note>
            <p>
                After you add your first virtual host, you will probably encounter a problem with accessing
                <code>http://localhost</code>. The simplest way to fix it is to add following entry <strong>
                before</strong> your custom hosts:
            </p>
            <snippet language="none">
<![CDATA[<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot [path to htdocs folder]
    ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>]]>
            </snippet>
            <p>
                <code>localhost</code> is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code> automatically, you don't need to
                add anything to <code>hosts</code> file.
            </p>
