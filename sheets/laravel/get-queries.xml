    <cheat title="Getting executed queries" id="query-logging">
        <p>
            Getting full list of <abbr>SQL</abbr> queries executed during a request could be
            very helpful in debugging. There is the simple way to return an array of all
            queries, either produced by Eloquent or <code>DB</code> class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting with Laravel 5 you need to enable query logging first. This is disabled
            by default to save some memory. Place following code before you execute any query.
        </p>
        <snippet language="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
DB::enableQueryLogging();]]>
        </snippet>
        <p>
            Then you can fetch the queries using <code>DB::getQueryLog()</code>. You can perform
            any operations on returned array or just use builtin <code>dd()</code> function if you
            need quick dump.
        </p>
        <snippet language="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
$queries = DB::getQueryLog();
dd($queries); // Just dump the array and stop script execution]]>
        </snippet>
        <p>
            The array is multidimensional - entry for each query consists of <abbr>SQL</abbr> command
            itself and nested array with currently binded values.
        </p>
