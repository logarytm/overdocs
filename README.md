OverDocs
========

OverDocs aims to be practical source of knowledge, both for beginners and advanced
developers. These first can learn best programming practices, while more experienced
users can utilize OverDocs as a handy reference complementary to manuals or books.

We didn't want to create another blog with tutorials. That's why while writing content
we are assuming that you have a basic knowledge of the topic. Such approach brings profits
for everyone. You don't have to read a wall of text, just a summary of the most important
informations, code snippets and reference for further reading.

There are tons of resources promoting obsolete or just wrong solutions. We would love to
focus on modern techniques and that's why we encourage everyone to join our efforts and share
a piece of their experience.
